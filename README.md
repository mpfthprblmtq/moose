## What *is* Moose?

The moose (North America) or elk (Eurasia), *Alces alces*, is a member of the New World deer subfamily and is the largest and heaviest extant species in the deer family. Most adult male moose have distinctive broad, palmate ("open-hand shaped") antlers; most other members of the deer family have antlers with a dendritic ("twig-like") configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates.

But that doesn't really have anything to do with this project, does it?  The better question is probably *"What is __this__ project?"*

## What is this project?

Moose is my pet project from college that turned out to be more useful than I anticipated.  It's basically just a mp3 information editor, where you can edit the Title, Artist, Album, Year, Genre, etc. for mp3 files.  There are a few different apps out there that do this same thing, but I've found that:
* I have to pay for them *(gross)*
* If they're free, they usually have features stripped away, and they'll ask you 17 times while using it over the course of 5 minutes if you want to try the paid version, usually followed by "If you don't pay for it, my kids can't eat!" or something like that.
* Most apps out there are very simple.  They only provide the ability to edit files one at a time, or just simply changing information about those files, with no automatic functionality.

I solved a lot of these problems I've seen with other applications by creating my own application!

## Running the project

The easiest way to get started with Moose is to just [download a fully working .dmg file](https://www.prblmtq.com/projects/moose/download) from my website.

*(I don't have a developer key yet to sign the app, so you'll just have to trust me for now.)*  
*(But chances are if you're here, I probably know you...)*

If you don't want to download a .dmg file, and you're a nerd like me, you try importing the project into your favorite IDE.
I have a walkthrough for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/mpfthprblmtq/moose/wiki/Getting-Started#for-intellij) in my Wiki.  Can't guarantee success rates for other IDEs.
